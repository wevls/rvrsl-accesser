## Purpose üî•

RVRSL is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool/Trojan)(forked from femboyaccess, credits to Ambr0sial) that uses the Discord platform as a C2C (command & control) server. More specifically, it uses your own custom Discord guild and then uses a bot account to send commands from the server to the victim's computer.

## Features ‚ú®

- almost undetectable
- escalate privileges without UAC
- can handle multiple machines at once
- a lot of commands
- silent

Rvrsl contains a stealth mode activated by default (line `61` to change that) that hides the Python window and changes the process name. 

## Usage üõ†

  1. Download Python with all the necessary requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r builder_requirements.txt` for the builder) and the repository to your computer.
  2. [Create a Discord bot](https://discord.dev/) (make sure to check all intents on) then invite it on a new server.
  3. Open `builder.py` and enter what's requested (server ID and bot token).
  4. Finished! Now, you can obfuscate it yourself if you want to. Whenever someone will open the generated `build.py` file, a new channel will be created in your defined server with a custom session ID. Type `help` to see a list of all available commands.

Note: FemboyAccess treats all machines like sessions and attributes them a 8-character long ID with letters and numbers. That's how the bot can manage multiple machines at the same time. The format of the generated channel name is something like:

`<computer_name>-<session_id>`

So if the computer's name is 'John', the channel name will be something like:

`John-6ef87f83`
